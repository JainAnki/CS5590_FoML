### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/JainAnki/CS5590_FoML/tree/main/BM21MTECH14001_Assign1/)
This homework is intended to cover programming exercises in the following topics:
- k-NN, Decision Trees, Model Selection, Naive Bayes classifier
- Determining the wine quality by implementing your own version of the decision tree using binary univariate split, entropy and information gain: 
   - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality - the Wine dataset

### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/JainAnki/CS5590_FoML/tree/main/BM21MTECH14001_Assign2/)
This homework is intended to cover theory and programming exercises in the following topics:
- SVM, Kernels
- soft-margin SVM to handwritten digits from the processed US Postal Service Zip Code data set: 
  - http://www.amlbook.com/data/zip/features.train 
  - http://www.amlbook.com/data/zip/features.test
- SVM to GISETTE is a handwritten digit recognition problem:
   - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gisette
   - variations: In addition to the basic linear kernel, investigate two other standard kernels: RBF (a.k.a. Gaussian kernel), Polynomial kernel   

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/JainAnki/CS5590_FoML/tree/main/BM21MTECH14001_Assign3/)
This homework is intended to cover programming exercises in the following topics:
- Neural Networks, Boosting/XGBoost, Random Forests
- Own random forest classifier (given you have written your own decision tree code) to apply to the Spam dataset 
   - data - https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.data
   - information - https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.info.txt
   - Explore the sensitivity of Random Forests to the parameter m (the number of features used for best split).
   - Plot the OOB (out-of-bag) error
- pre-processing methods and Gradient Boosting on the popular Lending Club dataset
   - Apply gradient boosting using the function sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier for training the model.
   - Get the best test accuracy you can, and show what hyperparameters led to this accuracy.
   - In particular, study the effect of increasing the number of trees in the classifier.
 
### [Assignment 4](https://github.com/JainAnki/CS5590_FoML/tree/main/BM21MTECH14001_Assign4/)

- Implement your own code for a logistic regression classifier
- Kaggle - Taxi Fare Prediction:
   - https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction
   - model should achieve at least RMSE < 4.

### [Assignment 5](https://github.com/JainAnki/CS5590_FoML/tree/main/BM21MTECH14001_Assign5/)
- This homework is intended to cover programming exercises in the following topics:
   - Clustering, Expectation Maximization, PCA, t-SNE  
   - Implement your own DBSCAN algorithm
   - Use sklearn’s t-SNE algorithm and reduce the ’load digits’ from sklearn.datasets 64-dimensional data to 2 dimensions
